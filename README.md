== Description ==

When you enter the site, you are greeted by a beautiful homepage, displaying different categories and items that are available.
You can see the contact details as well as your items in your shopping cart. You can then search for an item that you would like to purchase and add it to your shopping cart.
Each item gets stored in the stores database, which is submitted with the project. Each item is displayed with the required price and image, so you can see what you are purchasing.
You can also see if an item is available or not. 
If you click on the item, it will get added to your shopping cart, in which you can then see your shopping cart and proceed to checkout.
To my lecturer, I had to cut this project short because I had an emergency, so I had to go to the doctors and the hospital because of my appendix. 
I couldnâ€™t continue as the pain was too bad and I had to go because the appendix is serious and could lead to death if it bursts, so I had to go check it up.
Thank you for understanding.
